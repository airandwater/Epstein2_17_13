A conversation with Mark Epstein
[
These are notes from a phone conversation with Mark Epstein, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Cooper Union, on February 17, 2013. It was a ~3.5 hour conversation in which we both spoke very candidly, and with Mr. Epstein's permission I am sharing what we both said with the community. Instead of curating or editing in great detail, I thought it would be best to post the notes in their entirety. I apologize for taking over a week at this point. In the interest of transparency, I have uploaded them as quickly as possible without stopping to consider at great length how the whole document presents either one of us overall. 

This is a work in progress, but I felt it was important to post something before Friday's forum (deadline to submit questions is this Thursday morning: bit.ly/Trustee_Qs) in order to make that valuable time more productive. I know it's long, but please try to consider statements in their context without just copy/paste-ing random sentences. My plan was to include a synopsis, but at midnight I am barely able to summarize my work up to this point. I have done my best to summarize Part 1 with excerpts, but it is not a replacement for the entire conversation and I will likely edit it in the next few days. Part 2 summary and full notes will come soon.

These are not 100% accurate and are just my notes from the conversation. [??] generally denotes that something was missed. Words in square brackets were added by me after the fact. changes in topic are separated by a few blank lines. omissions during an excerpt are are denoted by .... jumps in conversation during excerpts are denoted by |||||||
