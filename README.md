A conversation with Mark Epstein
[
============================
UPDATE:

I apologize the 9 month gap between posting Parts 1 and 2. Inspired by the Working Group's efforts and #TwoWeeksOfLeaks, I became determined to finish and release Part 2 by today.

A lot has happened since Part 1 was posted: The Board of Trustees decided to charge tuition for those currently applying to enter The Cooper Union in 2014. A second occupation took place, this time in President Bharucha's office over most
of the summer. As a direct result, students will have representation on the Board and a Working Group was formed to find alternatives to charging tuition. Although it encountered initial stalls, the Working Group has passed a no tuition plan and will present it to the Board in less than a week. Barry Drogin (who Epstein refers to by name several times) was  elected to the group as Engineering Alumni Representative. Meanwhile new admissions staff has been hired, presumably to perfect the art of tipping a need-based sliding scale of aid, similarly to other institutions. Kevin Slavin, a write-in candidate was elected Alumni Trustee, proving that at least some alumni are paying attention to every piece of news that surfaces. The art program for high school students got a mega-donation that will keep it free, while the engineering program for high school students will cost $3000 starting next summer. TC Westcott and Linda Lemiesz, the administrative voices who were the greatest advocates for students, left under dubious circumstances. Votes of No Confidence totaled in the thousands. A new Dean of Engineering was hired with a background in online eduction research and computer science. 

I included a summary of events because it makes a large portion of this interview more pertinent. For example, Epstein expressed his views on threatening protestors with denial of degrees and closing the art school if they refused to play along with reinvention exercises. It appears that tuition was inevitable; Epstein had made up his mind at least 2 months before the Board met in April to make it official. Many of his views are strikingly similar to what was outlined in The Dream Scenario, a leaked slide presentation dated less than a week before this phone call. I don't think releasing the conclusion of my conversation sooner would have prevented any events from occurring differently, but it contribute to our knowledge of how long certain ideas have been in the pipeline. I hope that our conversation contributes to the ongoing debate on the school's future. I hope that I asked the right questions, pushed hard enough,
and posted it quickly enough for it to still matter.

========================================

These are notes from a phone conversation with Mark Epstein, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Cooper Union, on February 17, 2013. It was a ~3.5 hour conversation in which we both spoke very candidly, and with Mr. Epstein's permission I am sharing what we both said with the community. Instead of curating or editing in great detail, I thought it would be best to post the notes in their entirety. I apologize for taking over a week at this point. In the interest of transparency, I have uploaded them as quickly as possible without stopping to consider at great length how the whole document presents either one of us overall. 

This is a work in progress, but I felt it was important to post something before Friday's forum (deadline to submit questions is this Thursday morning: bit.ly/Trustee_Qs) in order to make that valuable time more productive. I know it's long, but please try to consider statements in their context without just copy/paste-ing random sentences. My plan was to include a synopsis, but at midnight I am barely able to summarize my work up to this point. I have done my best to summarize Part 1 with excerpts, but it is not a replacement for the entire conversation and I will likely edit it in the next few days. Part 2 summary and full notes will come soon.

These are not 100% accurate and are just my notes from the conversation. [??] generally denotes that something was missed. Words in square brackets were added by me after the fact. changes in topic are separated by a few blank lines. omissions during an excerpt are are denoted by .... jumps in conversation during excerpts are denoted by |||||||
