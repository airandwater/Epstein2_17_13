A conversation with Mark Epstein: Part 1 Summary

[ These are notes from a phone conversation with Mark Epstein, Chairman of the
Board of Trustees of The Cooper Union, on February 17, 2013. It was a ~3.5 hour
conversation in which we both spoke very candidly, and with Mr. Epstein's
permission I am sharing what we both said with the community. Instead of
curating or editing in great detail, I decided to post the notes in their
entirety. I apologize the 9 month gap between posting Parts 1 and 2. Inspired by
the Working Group's efforts and #TwoWeeksOfLeaks, I became determined to finish
and release Part 2 by today.

In many ways, our conversation is just as relevant today. I hope that our
conversation contributes to the ongoing debate on the school's future. I hope
that I asked the right questions, pushed hard enough, and posted it quickly
enough for it to still matter.

These are not 100% accurate and are just my notes from the conversation. [??]

EE: Im saying the library is doing a very good job archiving things now.... and
theyre drawing different conclusions than Jamshed has, as far as the intentions
of the school. Its pretty clear, you know, they let in everybody who could... it
was 1st come 1st serve basically, in the beginning. there was no merit barrier,
and it wasnt even "lets let the working classes come in," it was "anybody could
get in," anybody who could fit through the door could just attend 
ME: But then
when there was extra room, they would take in people who were willing to pay,
there had to be some thought to those who could just come in and those who would
pay if they were willing to. there had to be some bar, I dont know what it was,
but [??since they would raise it], it would make sense that there had to be some
limit, some line in the sand between those 2 things. either they were getting in
for nothing, or they were able to pay and they would do it. I dont know what the
answer is, but theres got to be something, some line in the sand, to divide
those 2 groups, right? 
EE: Well I think they were evaluated differently, when it
came time to actually do the courses. the amateurs were held to a lower
standard. and so it raises the question- 
ME: There were 2 different categories

EE: Right, and so it raises the question: do we want to return to that time in
our history?

|||||||||||||


ME: We have to come up with a plan that works, we cant just talk theory now
because of the position were in right now. thats the situation, something has to
be done. we cant do nothing anymore, thats what has to were be done. and were
trying to make it as sane, as painless, and reasonable, and keeping the
interests of the long term school at heart. I know whatever happens now, theres
going to be a few years of turmoil. whether we impose tuition, whether [??]
whatevers going to happen 
EE: Could you repeat that? you broke up a little 
ME: I
said that whatever happens, Im convinced theres going to be a few years of
turmoil at Cooper Union. no matter what sort of thing: whether tuition is
imposed, or the art faculty changes their mind again, I dont know. but I even
said, even if a school closes, all the options are on the table. whatever
happens, its not going to happen where were going to have a party. theres going
to be turmoil, theres going to be disruption. but whatever we decide, my goal is
that whatever is in place 10, 20, or 30 years from now, they look back and say
"Yea, it was a tough decision, it was a rough time, but it was the right one."
because whenever they look back 20 years from now, theyre going to say "That was
a rough time and it was a rough decision to make." whether they say it was the
right one or the wrong one, thats the question mark. I want to make sure its the
right one, thats my goal


|||||||||||||||||||||


EE: Ok, because I remember CDG came to cooper and they had a meeting during club
hours. and a couple of students were there, and we basically asked them "what
are you here to do? are you here to deliver a report?" and they said "well, we
really arent sure if there are going to be deliverables. but were here to look
at the operations and look at revenue and look at expenses and thing like that."
... so 1 of the big things that I was curious about was through this whole year
and a half is that yes, CDG comes on board, but how much are they looking at the
revenue side and how much are they looking at the expense side? because it seems
like the output that theyve provided to the cooper community has been a couple
of bar graphs showing how much money we can raise. but I feel like weve probably
paid them a sizeable amount, and Im wondering if theyve done anything on the
expense reduction side 
ME: I dont recall the answer to that. but look, these
problems that we knew, they were selected because they are pretty much the best
at what they do. and this is the kind of information you dont want to guess at.
we dont want our team, our inside team, to look at these kinds of questions. how
much money do we think we can raise with tuition versus how much do we think
people will pay? because you dont want to make a mistake on it. you dont want to
get that wrong. so you hire professionals who do this on a regular basis. thats
how its done. you cant expect the Board or the President or any 1 person to have
all the knowledge of all the different parts.  
EE: From what I remember, what I
recall, CDG were the ones who made the spreadsheets for the proposals, to model
things. the excel models. but Im just curious if they had done anything else
that anybodys aware of or not	
ME: I dont know the full extent of what they did
across the board with the administration, as they did with the trustees. I dont
know exactly what they [??] 
EE: Because thats the big question that some people
are raising is "Well, did they look at the expense reduction among the
administration and whats come of that?" or did they solely focus on the
spreadsheets. and I assume that because the Board meeting has been delayed that
the Trustees have had time to actually go through the models and play around
with them....

|||||||||||||||||


EE: Right, except they applied early. they got their materials in, and the
opinion among those students is that cooper didnt hold up its end of the bargain

ME: That can be their opinion, and I understood that because I dont know what
their opinion is or not. if thats their opinion then thats their opinion. but
the fact of the matter is, because of the reasons I told you, we could not have
acceptance letters going out without being 100% sure that we would have an
incoming class 

...


EE: ...or even if we were this concerned about the process, then we could have
just not had an early decision round this admissions cycle. but its too late for
that 
ME: Its being turned around, this was not a retaliatory or vindictive at
all against the art faculty. its not that. some people accuse us of that. its
not, its just that because of the situation, that the option had to be removed
from the table. because the art faculty had put us in a precarious situation.
Look, we dont have this problem from the engineering school, we dont have this
problem from the architecture school, but its a problem in the art school EE:
Well, I mean, the engineering school put out 5 reports: 1 of them was on
undergraduate tuition and that did not get approved 
ME: Yea, they [?discussed?]
it, they dont have to approve it 
EE: So the difference is those other 4 
ME: It
was a tie vote. [???] its a political move  [???] they dont want the students to
come back and say [???] they dont want to take responsibility 
EE: Everything is
a political move though 
ME: Look at what the art faculty did. they didnt prevent
us from moving forward with a plan, to save the school, to keep the cooper union
going. its going to be a struggle for a few years to get there, but were going
to look back in 10 years were going to say "it was a difficult time, but the
right decisions were made" theyre not being an obstacle to that 


|||||||||||||||||||||

and I said to them in the meeting "I have to go back and report to the Board
that your only suggestion is that we raise more money." I said that to them, and
I didnt get any argument or any comeback on that. so I went back to the Board
and I said "Look, all theyre saying is still - raise more money." and thats what
[???] said: thats the same thing the city opera, the symphony orchestra, they
all have the same stance. "Just go raise more money, make it happen." and the
city opera left lincoln center, and the orchestra, thats what they did. when the
financial crisis hit, 2008-2009, the federal government estimated that 1/3 of
all nonprofits either closed or merged, ok. those are real statistics


|||||||||||||||||||||||



EE: ...from what Ive heard, in the [art] admissions process youd get into Group
A, B, or C and they all have similar styles, attitudes, approaches, and approach
problems in different ways. and Im not going to knock any of the admissions
process. I think its done great to create a great, diverse student body. and the
fact that half of them come from new york, being in school in texas I can tell
you there is not as much diversity because youre only 
ME: Im not knocking it, Im
just saying this is the way it is 
EE: Right 
ME: They place the students in
different categories, so to say its a purely merit based [process?] is not true

EE: We have our pick, you see, those same concerns are everywhere. but there is
still a difference between the diverse cooper union class and the diverse
california class and the diverse texas class because were able to select from
the best of the best. and because our 200 are better than everybody elses 200.
and my concern is that our 200 are not going to be better than everybody elses
200 5 years from now 
ME: But the studies from the experts, and the opinions of
everyone involved in this from the professional side says that if we start
charging 25% tuition to those who could afford it, youre not going to affect the
student body. if you charge 50%, it will start affecting the student body. so
theres a cutoff point somewhere, obviously, between 25% and 50%. so we have to
be careful [???] this is exactly why you hire consultants who [?deal with this
stuff all the time?]. and with the engineering faculty report, it seems to me
that the staff could understand that shift to 75% scholarship instead of 100%
scholarship 
EE: No that is not the faculty report, the faculty did not approve
it 
ME: Again, they didnt not approve it, it was a political move 
EE: 


||||||||||


ME: ...[Jamshed is] giving each school the opportunity to help themselves. it
wasnt a competition between schools. they turned it into that. the art faculty
used the term "subtle coercion," did you see that? he didnt threaten them, he
said "if you dont come up with a plan that works, and is sustainable, an option
would be to close the school." if I tell you "if youre driving 20 miles above
the speed limit, youre gonna get 3 ponts on your license," thats not a threat or
subtle coercion. thats just an explanation of consequences of a particular
action. so jamshed didnt coerce anybody, he said it its not sustainable it might
close because its not sustainable.... open your eyes and see what it really is.
jamshed gave them the option to have their own destiny in their own hands, to
come up with a plan that you can live with and you can support. that was the
mission he gave them: come up with a plan that is sustainable, that you can
back, that you can support, and we will continue to work together and make it
happen. no ones trying to push the schools apart or put them against one
another, its infuriating to me that people try to turn it into that... if the
school is not sustainable, it will close. you dont have to be a harvard MBA to
grasp that concept. if you run out of money, youre out of business 
EE: One thing
that comes to mind though is that it might make more sense, it might be more
attractive to have a pre-med program in the school of engineering than it is for
an MFA, because MFAs are on the decline. and high school students cant exactly
pay ridiculous amounts for the summer or during the year. those are the sort of
options that are getting kicked around. so they basically concluded that 
ME: Its
not an either/or. this is what I mean, its not an either/or. what /youre/ doing
is /youre/ putting one school against the other. we never said its better to
have a pre-med program than an MFA in the art school. /you/ just placed the
schools together. thats the kind of conversation we never had in the boardroom.
if the engineering school feels that a med program is a good idea, which I think
that it is, fine. if the art school wants to make a fine arts program, thats
fine too. one thing has nothing to do with the other. its not a competition. Im
glad you said that, too. its exactly my point. /You/ made the competition out of
it, not us 
EE: I wouldnt say competition, Id say comparison, but I see what
youre saying 
ME: But were not even comparing them. All were comparing is are
they sustainable or not... look, the Board is responsible for the financial
stability of the school, so the numbers count. were also responsible for the
academic excellence of the school, and the teaching... but we are not local to
that type of solution. because we are not the ones who decide what we should be
teaching, for that we need the faculty.

...


ME: Im trying to make sure that the cooper union is here to teach whatever it
decides to teach. if the cooper union is not here, it doesnt matter because we
wont be here to teach it. we want to make sure cooper union is sustainable to
make sure that in years to come its still possible to be teaching what we should
be teaching. but the definition of that is Im going to look for others right
now. thats not the first thing on my plate right now. there are other things to
do, Im still on entree, Im still trying to get folks to be able to run a
sustainable school


|||||||||||||


ME: The price to build it, the contractors, it was a contract. if you start the
job by, you know, august 1, this is the price. but if you go beyond that, the
price would go up. thats normal. so we were nearing that date where we either
had to say go, or end up spending more for the building. [??because the new
building would not have arrived if we took the other deal??]. so what happened,
to bridge that gap, we took out a loan from metlife on the chrysler building,
[?? assessed what was happening?] and because there were great returns in the
market, and we were getting the loan from metlife for [??low interest??],  if we
could get more than we needed and invest the rest of it in the investment pool.
because if you figure we're paying 8% interest on the money and we're regularly
earning 20% interest on our investments, then its a wise move to borrow money
late 
EE: That dosent sound very conservative, though 
ME: Well, its pretty
conservative when youre investing those kind of returns for a long time, and
nobody anticipated the world collapsing. even if things went bad without
collapsing, we could have earned 8% on it 
EE: But I mean- 
ME: It wasnt like we
were going to lose all the money because of these investments. if it wasnt 20%,
even if it went down and we were only able to earn 6% on the money, and losing
2%, it was still worth the risk. thats not an unsafe risk, compared to [??taking
steps??], that we really needed because we werent charging tuition. nobody
wanted to think about charging tuition, that would have been another option.
borrowing a $175M loan, part of that (~$20M) went to paying off existing loans
we had on the dormitory

...


ME: all this talk about the building hurting us, thats not true. its one of
those made up facts that people dont want to let go of. its hard to convince
people because they dont want to hear you tell them that. "I had it wrong, but
the building ended up helping us," they will never admit to that. I dont know
how many times in the last year Ive had the same conversation with people. they
refuse to look at the facts and insist that the new building hurt us. look, we
had to pay tens of millions of dollars fixing up the old 2 buildings, and we
would have been left with 2 aging, crummy, fixed up buildings. [??] 
EE: So even
if- 
ME: If you were in the boardroom when the decisions were made, I bet you
would have seen the logic and would have voted the same way 
EE: I think some
professors, some faculty members, were in some of these discussions with the
building and brought up concerns, and they were ignored 
ME: Because they didnt
make sense, because the building didnt hurt us financially... $98M in the
endowment, we sold naming opportunities for $60M, thats over $150M that we got
for the new building. weve got the equivalent of $40M in the endowment with tax
payments. tell me where the building cost us money... part of the capital
campaign funds went into to the endowment, the general pool. that money was
invested. we still have $100-120M in the investable portion of the endowment. we
still have that. were not broke 
EE: Were not broke?! ...Every argument Ive seen
is that we /are/ broke, this is crisis, we need to do something 
ME: Were not
broke, we have a ~$650M endowment and ~$175M in debt. tell me where were broke

...


ME: People make the argument that if we didnt take the investment portion of the
endowment, $120M roughly, right? 
EE: Yes 
ME: And we borrowed $175M, lets say we
borrowed $150M (because some went to pay off the other loans). so we have $150M,
for arguments sake, in new money, borrowed. 120 in the endowment, we borrowed
150. if we didnt borrow it, where would we be? -$30M, we would be out of cash

EE: Part of looking back now- 
ME: Now the deficit ate up the loan [??] and we
continue to eat up what we have unless we do something now 
EE: Well I mean, a
large chunk of the deficit is the payments on the loan 
ME: Yes, we have to pay
off the loan, we have to pay the debt 
EE: Right 
ME: But it wasnt about the
building. money is flexible, if youre going to have [$170M??], 130 for the
building and the dormitory bonds. but in the meanwhile, new money is coming in
from the capital campaign in naming opportunities. so now its 175 and we got
$90M on the ground lease on the engineering building. so now the 175 is no
longer needed for the building. it went to the deficit. money is fungible that
way. [???...] my entire business career, my accountant put it all in basically 2
columns: money in, money out. thats all I needed to know.... thats why I had big
businesses and knew when they were finished. what started happening was, it was
great running a printing business, and then the digital age came about and
started chipping away at what we were doing. and we knew that the money coming
in was getting pretty damn close to the money going out, the business was
declining.... thats when I closed my business down, because I knew that was the
writing on the wall. I didnt have the option of charging more, who was going to
pay for it? I didnt have the option of charging tuition to people 
EE: Right,
well you could have taken out a loan 
ME: Take out a loan? If I took out a loan,
Id have to pay it off 
EE: Yes, thats what coopers doing right now 
ME: For me, it
was easier because it was a business, not a school, it was easier just to close
the business down. I could have taken out a loan, maybe just to [last longer??],
but then Id have to pay it off. there was no reason to keep that business going
any longer because it was obsolete. I dont think thatll happen to the cooper
union. so in that case it was good to take out a loan because it wasnt obsolete,
if you want to see it that way 
EE: Right. but then we should- 
ME: In a purely
business sense? yea, if it was a business, Id say close it down, sell off the
assets, return the investments of the shareholders, and call it a day. but thats
not what cooper union is about


||||||||||||||||||||||


EE: Its more of a question if cooper is still relevant. and I hope it is, but
have we outlived the 19th century ideals of cooper being relevant? 
ME: Well it
turns out the story that we think, unfortunately, it turns out the story that we
think is so compelling, the achievements and, you know, the quality, the all the
other stuff . it turns out its not as compelling to others as it is to the
cooper community


|||||||||||||


ME: What if the Board said "you know what? we understand the recommendation of
the faculty and the Dean, but what if we dont want to grant degrees to kids who
set that example, who are so disrespectful? what if [??we dont think that is??]
what a cooper union student should be?" and we say "you know what, lets give out
degrees to everybody else but lets not grant degrees to these kids." thats our
protest. do you think theyd like that? 
EE: No 
ME: We have the right to do that.
Im not advocating that we do, but ... if they want to protest in a creative
form, we can do it too


||||||||||||||||


ME: but right now we could use more academics on the Board. we had a president
of another university on the Board but she had to retire a couple of years ago.
again Id love to get another, we might get another college president on the
Board, I wouldnt mind getting a couple more... cooper was limited to 25 trustees
for a long time... we have that permission for up to 40 trustees now...  
EE: Is
there any advantage to having more board members, other than having more
donations? 
ME: Theyre there because first of all to give with more capacity to
raise more money. part of the development of the board members is that most
places have whats called a "give or get" policy: give money of your own or get
money from other people....  
EE: ...is that a valid strategy that the art
faculty said, then? raise more money, theres more trustees, theres more minimum
donations, theres more "give or get"? 
ME: No.  
EE: Its not enough?

||||||||||||


ME: Sure [jamshed] has a vision for the school, hes presented it to the Board.
but now is not the time to go public with that kind of stuff because theres too
much stuff going on 
EE: Ok 
ME: Solve the financial thing and then we come out
with the vision. and then we start a new capital campaign to raise money for
that vision. thats how its done 
EE: Well, I think a lot of people have been
waiting on that for a year and a half 
ME: Well you know the general rule of
thumb, when a college president starts on the job, the advice that has been
given to every other college president, the general rule of thumb is "dont make
any decisions for a year." jamshed came into this and had to hit the ground
running. it was a very difficult situation financially... we originally took a
vote of confidence in jamshed and it was unanimous. the whole board thinks
jamshed is [?good?] for the job. [???...???] but people dont want to hear that.
people like, you know, bloodshed 
EE: Well, its hard to evaluate his vision if I
dont know what it is. but going back, 1 of my concerns with jamshed is him as a
fundraiser. I know that he goes all around the country for alumni events and
trys to raise money, but I have no indication of how successful hes been ME:
Well hes gotten some money from some alumni, but hes also unhelped by the fact
that   non alum now with a large gift of support [??of the students??}... hes
trying to get a big gift, possibly, from a non alumnus. from other places that
he knows 
EE: Ok, so is this separate from- 
ME: Understand that people have said
to jamshed, "why should I give you money to pay for the education of a kid whose
father makes more than I do? who doesnt pay?" we have an art 
EE: Well, I think
that the case- 
ME: ...whose father is one of the most famous artists on the
planet. extremely successful artist. if I mention his name, youll know it. he
hasnt given us anything

|||||||||||||||


ME: Heres another thing that Barry Drogin [editor of the Alumni Pioneer,
engineering alumni representative to the Working Group] wrote. lets say you make
a $1M gift. as soon as you make that pledge, its counted towards the total, ok?
$100M capital campaign and you donated $1M, thats 1% of the campaign thats been
completed 
EE: Right 
ME: You pay it off over 5 years. so in year 1, you paid
$200k. in year 2, you paid $200k. barry drogin looked at that and said "the
school said that they raised $1M, but I only see $400k! wheres the other $600k?
they took that! ... tens of millions of dollars in bequests as part of the
capital campaign. we didnt get that cash yet, but we know its coming. barry
drogin asks "where is the rest of the money? who lied?" ...  
EE: I think part of
the issue is- 
ME: You dont donate that much to the cooper union and then [??it
disappears and is unaccounted for??] thats what barry drogin is saying 
EE: I
understand, but part of the issue then, is that the $1M figure gets publicized
as "we raised this much," but then being a realist you cant pay the bills with
that and you cant- 
ME: ...we dont keep the campaign going for another 5 years
until we have $250M cash in hand. the total is cash in pledges, thats the way
capital campaigns have always been run, thats the norm 
EE: Ok 
ME: We dont wait
until the last donor dies to then claim the capital campaign was successful ...

EE: I think its just the shift in all the good news, and now all the actual
news. because we had heard that "Oh, capital campaign is doing great" and then
we hear "Well, theres not enough money." and now all the admissions materials,
instead of lauding the "free as air and water, full tuition," now all the
promotional materials are just very safe. and I wanted- 
ME: Well part of the
thing was the news that went out was that the previous administration, their
approach to it.. look, nothing the board said was untrue. we did not make any
statement that were not true, ok. but the spin on it was... people dont donate
money to organizations in trouble. its very hard to raise money for
organizations in trouble.

||||||||||||||||


EE: ... but thats a huge point that needs to be considered whenever we talk
about this 20% donation, participation figure. Things, you know, seemed ok. And
before that, before the past 10 years, it was higher 
ME: The board of trustees
never, that was the administrations problem it wasnt ours. but ...we now have a
communications committee on the board of trustees who are working on getting
those communications problems solved. thats pretty fair... I didnt like the
message going out ...  
EE: One thing that - as were talking about
communications... I saw a job posting for the Dean of Engineering that, again
much like the marketing materials, just seemed very safe... it didnt even have
the word "scholarship" in it. it said "yes, we have 1000 very gifted students,"
no mention of merit-based, full tuition scholarships anywhere. and thats the
fundamental principle of the school 
ME: Thats not the boards job, but I think
that anybody that would be applying for that position at cooper union would
probably be aware of the scholarship thing... maybe they should have put that
in, but thats not a board decision

||||||||||||||


EE: I thought that the selection process for jamshed was a little different, I
remember hearing an anecdote about trustee Stan Lapidus sort of met him one
weekend...  
ME: No, what happened was its a very confidential process, but
jamshed was not in the initial pool... we contacted him because his name came
up, its no secret that jamshed was at tufts. stan is from massachusetts. so he
met with him and came back and said he thought that was good, and he put jamshed
in the pool and went through the same [street?] as everybody else 
EE: Right ME:
So the fact that drogin is saying that stan lapidus usurped the power of the
admissions committee to bring in a [???], again, its the farthest thing from the
truth and does a disservice to the school. 

||||||||||||||||


ME: ...theres a thing about Jonathan Rose and the new building. when you build a
building like this, you hire an owners rep. the person was hired to watch over
the interests of the owner... now Bill Sandholm was in the real estate game his
entire life, the big developer. so he works for the Rose family. [??] now
jonathan rose happens to be an owners rep, thats what he does. thats his
business 
EE: Right 
ME: So bill knows him. so we were looking for a
recommendation for owners rep, and bill said "you should consider jonathan
rose." he knows him to be a guy of quality for that kind of a job. so jonathan
rose was put into the pool 
EE: Well theres also Sandra Priest Rose, right? ME:
Now when it came time to vote, on who they should select, bill sandholm,
promptly recused himself from voting. because he had brought jonathan rose in,
and he works for the rose family, because there was an appearance of a potential
conflict of interest. [???] he recused himself from the vote 
EE: Oh, ok 
ME: And
jonathan rose was voted in 
EE: I wasnt aware of that. every time anybody asked
about conflicts of interest, they say that "well, the blank form is publically
available but peoples actual conflict of interest statements are confidential,"
so thats news to me that he did not actually vote. I mean it makes sense, but
its news to me 
ME: Now, after the fact, Sandy Rose became a trustee of the
school, who is jonathans mother 
EE: Right 
ME: From the Rose family. barry still
says, "theyre related, arent they?" during the capital campaign, she donated $5M
to the school. it was the largest gift we ever got. thats why we got the rose
auditorium, in the new adacemic building... Jonathans contract to be the owners
rep was for about $250k, which is a fair price for that kind of a job for that
size building. thats all. drogin throws it around that sandy donated $5M so that
jonathan would get the job,... jonathan had the job before sandy joined and
donated money... wheres the conflict, whats the problem with that? 
EE: This is
the first time Ive heard it. people have been looking for an answer for that for
a long time, and this is the first time Ive heard of that. and this is the sort
of thing that could be avoid if we just had a list of who the trustees are and
when they became trustees ...  
ME: ...you cant convince people who are working
on their own facts... this guy drogin doesnt know what hes talking about and
"uncovering all these shenanigans," hes uncovering nothing...
